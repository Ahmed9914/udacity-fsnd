# Lesson

1. Sites On Mobile

    Pete LePage, front-end advocate at Google
    Cameron Pittman, course developer at Udacity

    Google News uses a fully responsive layout for mobile, and a less responsive version for desktops. They have to maintain the two different versions. The Skinny Ties site is always fully responsive. I also found the creator of the Skinny Ties site, [Gravity Department](http://gravitydept.com/). 

2. Quiz: Share Your Great & Awful Sites

    Responsive sites

    - curator.io
    - material.io

    Instructor answer:

3. Intro to Project

    - Cameron mentioned "lessons 2, 4, and 5," which I think is in reference to the standalone responsive design course.

          reach through the browser, it uses the full capabilities of the device

          never showing the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.</li>
        <li><span class="compare-yes"></span> <b><a href="#engaging">Engaging</a></b> - Keeps the user coming back
          to the app with beautifully designed experiences that look and feel
          natural.</li>
      </ul>
