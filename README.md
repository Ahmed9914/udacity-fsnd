## Intro 

This is a repository for Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program course notes and materials.

The [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) was co-created by Udacity, Amazon, GitHub, AT&T, and Google. The program teaches skills including Python programming, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX for front-end development, back-end databases, and Linux server deployment.


## Lessons

Notes and other materials from the lessons are available in this repository.

1. **Programming foundations**
	- Python programming basics
	- The Web: HTML, CSS and responsive design
2. **Developer tools**
	- Bash
	- Git and GitHub
	- HTTP requests
3. **The back-end**
	- SQL and relational databases
	- CRUD and web servers
	- OAuth
	- APIs
4. **The front-end**
	- JavaScript
	- AJAX
5. **Servers**
	- Linux server deployment


## Projects

The Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is focused on projects, in which students can independently implement what they have learned in the lessons.

I stored each project in its own repository.

* [Project 01](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd01-p01-movies): Python web server
* [Project 02](https://br3ndonland.github.io/udacity/): Portfolio website
* [Project 03](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd03-p01-logs): SQL database analysis
* Project 04: Item catalog app
* Project 05: Neighborhood map
* Project 06: Linux server


## Code

Python code is written in [Kenneth Reitz's Code Style](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/if-i-could-amend-pep-8), an amended [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) format.

For the foundational Python programming work (part 1, lessons 00-11), I took notes and ran my code in Jupyter notebook files. Jupyter notebook was a nice way to bundle Markdown-formatted notes with Python code, but it lacked the speed and autocompletion features of my preferred text editor, Sublime Text.

As I continued, I started writing my code in Sublime Text, keeping separate files for code and Markdown notes.
