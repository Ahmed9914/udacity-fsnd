**Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program**

## Description

General repository for Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program course notes and materials. Step right up and learn about the cool things I'm doing with Udacity! Also see my Udacity portfolio website at https://br3ndonland.github.io/udacity/.


## Program

The [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) was co-created by Udacity, Amazon, GitHub, AT&T, and Google. The program teaches skills including Python programming, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX for front-end development, back-end databases, and Linux server deployment.


## Code formatting

Python code is [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.

For the foundational Python programming work (lessons 00-11), I took notes and ran my code in Jupyter notebook files. Jupyter notebook is a nice way to bundle Markdown-formatted notes with Python code, but it lacks the speed and autocompletion features of Sublime Text. As I continued into front-end web development, I started writing my code in Sublime Text, keeping separate files for code and Markdown notes.
