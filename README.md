## Description
[(Back to TOC)](#toc)

This is a repository for [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) (FSND) course notes and materials.


## Code
[(Back to TOC)](#toc)

### Markdown

**Markdown is a syntax for easy generation of HTML pages from plain text files.** It has most of the functionality of HTML while being much easier to read, and is very widely used (for example, READMEs on GitHub).

I take notes on the lessons in Markdown. When coding projects, I also keep **computational narratives** describing what I do at each step, like journals or lab notebooks. Examples of my computational narratives are available for projects including the [portfolio website](https://br3ndonland.github.io/udacity/methods/) and the [SQL database logs analysis](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd-p3-sql/blob/master/logs-methods.md). I also created a [Markdown guide](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-google/blob/master/markdown-guide.md) during the Grow with Google program to explain how I use Markdown.


### Python

Python code is formatted for Python 3 and [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). [Kenneth Reitz's Code Style](https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/if-i-could-amend-pep-8), an amended [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) format, is used when permitted.

For the foundational Python programming work (part 1, lessons 00-11), I took notes and ran my code in Jupyter notebook files. Jupyter notebook was a nice way to bundle Markdown-formatted notes with Python code, but it lacked the speed and autocompletion features of my preferred text editor, Sublime Text.

As I continued, I wrote code in Sublime Text, keeping separate files for code and Markdown notes.


## Projects
[(Back to TOC)](#toc)

The Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is focused on projects, in which students can independently implement what they have learned in the lessons. I stored each project in its own repository.

1. [Python web server movie trailer site](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd-p1-python-movie-site)
2. [Portfolio website](https://br3ndonland.github.io/udacity/)
3. [SQL database logs analysis](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd-p3-sql)
4. [Python Flask catalog app](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-fsnd-p4-flask-catalog)
5. Neighborhood map app
6. Linux server deployment


## Lessons
[(Back to TOC)](#toc)

Udacity provides lessons prior to each project. The lesson curriculum could benefit from some reorganization. I have included my suggested organization below, and have organized repository materials in my suggested order.
